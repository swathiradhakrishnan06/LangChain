> 🚧 This repository is a work in progress. Content will be updated as new components are completed.

**LangChain** is an open‑source framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs) It provides modular building blocks—such as prompt templates, chains, agents, and vector stores—that can be assembled into complex, production‑ready pipelines.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

* **Document Loaders:** Interfaces for loading data from various sources like text files, PDFs, web pages, etc.
* **Document Splitting:** Techniques to chunk large documents into manageable pieces for processing.
* **Embeddings:** Convert text into numerical vectors using models like OpenAI or Hugging Face for semantic understanding.
* **Vector Stores:** Specialized databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma) to store and retrieve embedded documents efficiently.
